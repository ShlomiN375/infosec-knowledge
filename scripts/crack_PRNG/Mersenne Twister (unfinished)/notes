After the initial twist, mt[0] is always 0x80000000. (I think they wanted to XOR it, but it's assigned)
Could this lead to some cryptographical insecurity? - Not really, the state[0] is always the same, but it changes based on state[1] immediately anyways.

MTRandom is supposed to inherit from Random, thus nextInt() would
go through Random and call next()

We are in the middle of the twister, index is 300. When we obtain the next 624 states, how does the twist work? 
Will there be no difference if we start from the middle? (state[0] is twisted from state[623], or is state[0] the same as state[623], etc?
